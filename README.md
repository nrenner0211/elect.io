## About

This is our third and final group project! Inspired by lack of information around elections, especially geared towards young people. User Story:

`AS someone wanting to vote, perhaps for the first time`

`I WANT a convenient, non-partisan source of local election information`

`SO THAT I can find out where I need to go to vote`

## Requirements

- Use React
- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Include authentication (JWT).
- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards.
- Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
- BONUS: is installable
